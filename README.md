# samples
Phil Newman's repository to share samples and tools.

This repository contains scripts and tools to help understand spending in your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy. The scripts were hacked together quickly to demonstrate what is possible (by a python beginner). I have tried to document everything clearly.
While I do work at Oracle, these scripts have not been through the rigorous process that our production codes goes through and are by no means official.
